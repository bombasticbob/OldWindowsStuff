0) ** IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO DESTROY A FILE IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY **
   ** SPECIFY THE SOURCE NAME WITH NO DESTINATION FILE!!!!       **
1) command args on WINCMD should be displayed at the initial prompt
2) copy to 'PRN' should involve PRINTMAN!
3) RENAME/MOVE functions (using 'canonical' names) fail under NETWARE
4) UAE on exit from .BAT called from FOR command when you hit ctrl-break
   and CANCEL the operation.
5) NOVELL NETWARE does not like device names with COPY command - fix!
   (This is probably due to 'canonical' names using '\\SERVER\path')
6) Does '>>' work properly on redirections?
7) Check the SENDKEYS and SENDVIRTUALKEY functions to ensure they work the
   way you would normally want them to.  If possible, post keystroke 
   messages to the SYSTEM QUEUE vice the task's message queue!
8) PLAYSOUND should allow 'SYSTEM SOUND' names to be specified.  At this
   time, it only accepts file names.
