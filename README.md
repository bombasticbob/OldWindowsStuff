This is available 'as-is'.  It may not compile, it may not work, it may
not do anything at all.  but it's here if anyone wants to look at it to
see how something MIGHT be done, such as formatting a diskette or making a
trashcan that's compatible with 'Program Manager' on old NT or Win 3.x
computers, or looking at the internal guts of Windows '95 using some
interesting VxD hacks.
