INT 21h function 4302h

Get physical size.  The physical size is the amount of space the
given file or directory occupies on the volume.  For compressed
volumes, this is the compressed size.  For uncompressed volumes,
this is the file size rounded up to the nearest cluster boundary.
Note that this call works on directories as well as files; thus,
you can tell how much space a directory itself consumes.

ENTRY	(AX) = 4302h
	(DS:DX) = path pointer

EXIT	Carry clear
	    (DX:AX) = physical size of file or directory in bytes
	Carry set
	    (AX) = error code
